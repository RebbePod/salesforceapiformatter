# Privacy Policy

**Salesforce API Name Formatter** respects your privacy and is committed to protecting any personal information that you may provide while using this extension. This Privacy Policy outlines how the extension handles your data and ensures your privacy.

## 1. Data Collection

This extension does not collect, store, or share any personal information. The extension operates locally on your browser and processes data only for the purpose of formatting input fields according to Salesforce API naming conventions. No data is sent to external servers or third parties.

## 2. Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions to function properly:

- **activeTab**: This permission allows the extension to interact with the current active tab and format the content on the page (e.g., replacing invalid characters in form input fields).
- **scripting**: The scripting permission is used to inject the necessary code into web pages to modify input fields for Salesforce API name formatting.
- **storage**: This permission allows the extension to store user preferences, such as the selected replacement characters and macro settings, so they persist across sessions.

## 3. Data Usage

The data processed by the extension (such as form inputs) is handled locally within your browser and is not transmitted outside of your device. User preferences for character replacements and macros are stored locally using Chrome's `storage` API to enhance the user experience.

## 4. Third-Party Services

This extension does not use any third-party services for analytics, tracking, or advertising. There are no remote calls or communications with external servers.

## 5. Security

We take reasonable measures to ensure that your information is secure. As this extension does not transmit or store personal information beyond your device, there is no risk of your data being accessed by unauthorized third parties.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are encouraged to review this page periodically for any changes.
